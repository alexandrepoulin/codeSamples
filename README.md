Here are some samples that might come in handy doing things.

autoClicker.py: clicks the mouse as fast as possible if its inside a designated rectangle on the screen (used to cheat at clicker hero)

emailSender.py: example of how to send an email. Used when I wanted a notification on when a mathematica process was done.

gifFrames.py: Take a give, and save each frame as its own picture

imageConverter.py: Changes the colors of a picture by applying a matrix transformation to the rgb values. Useful for knowing how to manipulate images and checking to see if something would look good to colorblind individuals or in black and white.

keyLog.py: useful for knowing how to handle keyboard events and how to record them if needed. Definetly not nefarious in any way.

livestream.py: takes a picture with a camera and updates a frame so that it looks like a video.

runaway.py: example of playing a game. Takes a screen shot of the screen, analyses some pixel values and then solves the puzzle.
